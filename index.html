        <div class = "container"<p class = "bio"> I'm a first year at Barnard College and am from New York. I'm a simple person: I like eating, sleeping, watching anime/kdramas/Netflix and hanging out with friends. Fun facts(?) about me: I can understand Japanese and reply to emails/messages really fast.</p>
        <p> Academically, I want to study computer science but I don't have any concrete ideas after that. In the spirit of Columbia culture, I also want to be a sellout and do a minor in economics/finance. </p></div>
