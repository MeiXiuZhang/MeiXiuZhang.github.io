            <h2 id = "about"> Background on me, Mei Xiu Amy Zhang</h2>
            <p class = "about"> I am a current freshman at Barnard College, <br>
            studying CS (Computer Science) and perhaps minoring in economics<br>
            (in the spirit of our sell out culture). I am originally from New <br>
            York City and am happily proud to be a first generation, low  income<br>
            student. I come from a family of five and am the youngest of three <br>
            siblings (born to immigrant parents). As such, I am the most talkative, <br>
            loudest and most annoying of the three. I have always been short and <br>
            have always studied hard in school, willing to wake up at 5 AM on weekday<br>
            mornings and arriving at school before 7:30 AM. Being unable to depend <br>
            on my father, I saw myself grow up in many ways: I became outspoken <br>
            when someone made racial slurs against my culture, I became comfortable <br>
            with public transportation and I became the chaperone at doctor appointments. <br>
            One of my favorite memories from high school was Girls Who Code, a company<br>
            whose summer immersion program showed me that women can pursue their dreams <br>
            and that STEM is a place for women. Through this program, I learned <br>
            about coding, mentorship and my desire to be an empowering young women. <br>
            Although my parents are still worried about a girl going into <br>
            a male-dominated field, I've learned not to let critiques or <br>
            fear stop me. And here I am now, well on my way to creating a tradition<br>
            of proud, Barnard graduates in the Zhang family.</p>

            <h2> Fun Facts about Me</h2>
            <h3> Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <p> I am interested in Kpop and anime <br> and have learned
                to speak Japanese from 8 years of watching anime without subtitles.<br> I am an
                avid fan of EXO and have learned to sing almost all their songs<br> and have even
                edited videos dedicated to them. Through this experience, <br>I have knowledge in Windows 
                Movie Maker, Audacity and basically all the <br>platforms of Microsoft.
                I go to the gym a lot and do only cardio <br>(cuz I can't do core/arm exercises to save my life).
                My favorite sport is badminton (mostly because <br>tennis racquets are too heavy for me). 
                I believe in self-care so I'm always on the lookout<br> for good Korean skincare products.
                I am very interested in learning piano but man, <br> that's an expensive idea of a hobby so 
                I'm probably not going to learn it.<br>
            <h3> Favorite Things</h3>
            <p> I have many favorite people but the one I have loved all my life is my family,<br> especially
                my sister. I'm one of those barbarians that eats<br> ice cream straight out of the carton and
                loves ice cream to the point where I<br> will sacrifice my face and image for it (I'm called the 
                Yeti Zhang <br>after the Snowdays mascot because I eat too much ice cream). Also a big fan of 
                bubble tea and tea in general.<br> I love cardio and any form of it. <br> I'm that mom figure 
                who can't stop giving random pep talks<br> and encouraging remarks. 
                Oh and for the record, I like inspirational quotes and math (debatable). <br></p>
            <h2 id = "first_year"> Life as a Barnard Freshman</h2>
            <h3> Current Me</h3>
            <p> I take 8:40 classes almost everyday of the week and am <br>constantly in meetings for my favorite
                time commitment, the "tech frat of Columbia University" ADI.<br> I am also on the Student Government Association at Barnard<br>
                as a Class Representative and also have weekly meetings for that.<br> More than ever, I am passionate to be a woman pursuing CS
                and meeting mentors <br> has made me want to become one in the ever growing STEM field.<br> In fact, I am a coordinator
                for the CS Mentorship program because I <br> want to match more freshmen/sophomores to more experienced students that
                they can <br> help them in many differnt ways (especially outside of just <br> academics).
                I don't procrastinate so find me in my room, writing another<br> essay
                or coding for actual class or for personal interest. I actually <br> sleep a lot more than I did in 
                high school and *gasp* socialize.<br> 
            TL;DR: Stress culture is real but it's a fun time :)</p>
